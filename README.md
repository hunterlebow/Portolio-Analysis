The Sharpe Ratio explains how many units of excess return will be achieved above the risk free rate per one unit of risk as defined by the standard deviation of your portfolio.
A sharpe ratio below 0.0 means your portfolio is being outperformed by the risk free rate
A sharpe ratio between 0.0 and 0.5 leaves much room for improvement in your portfolio
A sharpe ratio betweeen 0.5 and 1.0 has value but leaves room for improvement
A sharpe ratio above above 1.0 is good
A sharpe ratio above 2.0 is great
A sharpe ratio above 3.0 is exceptional
